SimpleTimeTrackerApp
====================

A simple but non-trivial iOS app implementing a task time tracker just the way I like it. It uses CoreData to store a model  of Tasks and TaskIntervals (when work was started-ended). This is meant as an ongoing place to learn and experiment with latest iOS features.
